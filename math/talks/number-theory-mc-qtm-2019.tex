	\startitemize [m]

		\item  What is number theory?

		\item  Why do we study number theory?

		\item  Why do we want to \emph{prove} ideas?

		\item  More importantly, what constitutes a \emph{proof}?

		\item  Inductive vs deductive reasoning.

\startslide[title={Inductive reasoning}]

	\startitemize [4]

		\item  \bold{Inductive reasoning} derives general propositions from specific examples.
		
		\item  \bold{Caution}: \emph{We can never be sure, our conclusion(s) can be wrong!} \frown

		\item  \emph{Example} 1:
			\startitemize [n, joinedup]
				\item  We throw lots of things, very often.
				\item  In all our experiments, the things fell down and not up.
				\item  So we conclude that likely, things always fall down.
			\stopitemize

			\blank[big]
			How we may be wrong:
			\startitemize [n, joinedup]
				\item  An iron nail under a big magnet moves up (given that it is sufficiently close).
				\item  A helium balloon goes up.

\startslide[title={Inductive reasoning: problems}]

	\startitemize [4]

		\item  \emph{Example} 2:  You ask your parent for a candy and (s)he buys it for you. You ask for a fancy shoe, and (s)he buys it. Now you ask for a Lamborghini ⋯.

		\item  \emph{Example} 3 (\emph{Black swan}):  In the 16th century, it was believed (in Europe) that swans are always white. But in 1697, Dutch explorers led by Willem de Vlamingh became the first Europeans to see black swans, in Western Australia.

		\item  \emph{Example} 4:  \m{\frac11 = 1, \frac22 = 1, \frac33 = 1, ⋯}; so clearly \m{\frac{n}{n} = 1} for every integer \m{n}.

		\item  \emph{Example} 5:  Illusions, e.g. drawings by \emph{M. C. Escher}.

	\startitemize [4]

		\item  \bold{Deductive reasoning} is deriving a logically certain conclusion from one or more premises.

		\item  We do \emph{NOT} question the premises. But \emph{if the premises are correct, then all conclusions are correct.} \smile

		\item  \emph{Example}: Question: Do \m{\bf{Q_1}} and \m{\bf{Q_2}} \emph{imply} \m{\bf{Q_3}}?
			\startitemize [5, joinedup]
				\item  (\m{\bf{Q_1}})  All men are mortal. (First premise)
				\item  (\m{\bf{Q_2}})  Socrates is a man. (Second premise)
				\item  (\m{\bf{Q_3}})  Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (Conclusion)
			\stopitemize

		\item  \emph{Example}: Question: Does \m{\bf{P_1}} and \m{\bf{P_2}} \emph{imply} \m{\bf{P_3}}?
			\startitemize [5, joinedup]
				\item  (\m{\bf{P_1}})  Borogoves are mimsy whenever it is brillig.
				\item  (\m{\bf{P_2}})  It is now brillig, and this thing is a borogove.
				\item  (\m{\bf{P_3}})  Hence this thing is mimsy.

	\startitemize [4]
		
		\item  To prove an existential proposition \important{true}, we need to find just one instance (\emph{example}) for which the proposition is \important{true}.

\startslide [title={Natural numbers and integers}]

	\startitemize [m]
		
		\item  From ancient times, humans have been able to identify the natural numbers.
			
			In modern mathematics, the \emph{set} of natural numbers is represented by \m{ℕ = \bcrl[1, 2, 3, ⋯]}.

		\item  We can add/subtract, and multiply/divide any two natural numbers.

		\item  Are these all the numbers there can be?

		\item  Question: Are the natural numbers \important{closed} under addition/subtraction?

			\comment{(Being closed with respect to an operation means that the result is also in the given set.)}
			\startitemize [a, joinedup]				
				\item  I had 4 objects, and I gave 4 objects to Luci. How many objects do I now have?
				\item  I owed Luci 20 \$, but I have 4 \$ with me. How much do I have?
			\stopitemize

		\item  This gives rise to the integers, \m{ℤ = \bcrl[⋯, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ⋯]}, which are \important{closed} under addition/subtraction.

		\item  From now on, we shall forget about subtraction, because subtracting an integer is essentially adding the negative of that integer. 
	\stopitemize
\stopslide

\startslide [title={Rational numbers}]
	
	\startitemize [m]

		\item  Note that the set of natural numbers is contained within the set of integers.

			In set theory, we say \quotation{\m{ℕ} is a \important{subset} of \m{ℤ}}, and denote this by \m{ℕ ⊂ ℤ}.
		
		\item  Are the integers closed with respect to multiplication/division?

		\item  This gives rise to the set of rational numbers, \m{ℚ = \bcrl[\frac{p}{q} : p, q ∈ ℤ, q ≠ 0]}.

		\item  And now we can forget about division since it is simply multiplication with the inverse of the number.

		\item  Is that all we have?

		\item  Let's go on a journey.
	\stopitemize

\startslide [title={Time Travel adventures: Part 1}]

	Date: around 550 BC

	Place: Pythagoras's office in Samos, Greece

	Stage: Pythagoras has recently claimed that he has proved a major equality about the sides of right-angled triangles. We go there to investigate his claims.

	\blank[big]

	Unfortunately, a lot of people have been trying do the same, so he has a filtering mechanism in place. We need to answer the following question to get in:
	
	\startitemize [m]
	
		\item  What is the area of a rectangle of dimensions \m{a × b}?
		
		\item  What is the area of a right angled triangle of base \m{b} and height \m{h}?

			But of course, now he wants a proof of that fact.

			\comment{(Remember that Pythagoras is a geometer, so he is very happy with a geometric proof.)}
		
		\item  What is the sum of angles of a triangle?
	\stopitemize

	Once we answer these question, we get to see Pythagoras's proof.

\startslide [title={We start with a lemma}]
	
	\startlemma
		Let \m{n} be an integer. The \m{n^2} is even iff \m{n} is even.
	\stoplemma

	\startproof
		\comment{Note that this is a ⟺ statement. So we can break it into two parts.}

		Before we look at the individual directions, let us note that when \m{p} is an integer, so are \m{p^2}, \m{2 p}, \m{2 p^2}, and \m{2 p^2 + 2p}.

		\bold{(⟸)}
		\comment{We use a direct proof for this direction.}

		Since \m{n} is even, there is an integer \m{p} such that \m{n = 2p}. Now, \m{n^2 = (2 p)^2 = 4 p^2 = 2 (2 p^2)}, so \m{n^2} is even.

		\bold{(⟹)}
		\comment{We prove this by proving the contrapositive.}

		Suppose \m{n} is \emph{not} even, that is, \m{n} is odd. Then we can write \m{n = 2 p + 1} for some integer \m{p}. Then \m{n^2 = (2 p + 1)^2 = 4 p^2 + 4 p + 1 = 2 (2 p^2 + 2 p) + 1}, so \m{n^2} is also odd.

	\comment{Remark: A \emph{lemma} is a proposition that leads to a bigger result, which are usually called \emph{theorems}. \emph{Corollaries} are applications or minor modifications of theorems that are themselves quite important.

\startslide [title={Rationality of \m{\sqrt2}}]
	
	\starttheorem [title={Euclid}]
		\m{\sqrt2} is not rational.
	\stoptheorem

	\startproof
		\comment{We prove this by contradiction.}

		Suppose \m{\sqrt2} is rational. Then it can be written in the form \m{\frac{p}{q}}, where \m{p, q} are integers with \m{q ≠ 0}. Assume that \m{p} and \m{q} have no common factors, for if they do, we can reduce the fraction to its lowest terms and then call the numerator \m{p} and the denominator \m{q}.

		Squaring and simplifying, we get
		\placeformula[sqrt2-notin-Q-eq1]  \startformula
			p^2 = 2 q^2 .

		This means \m{p^2} is even. By the previous lemma, \m{p} is also even. Therefore, there exists an integer \m{r} such that \m{p = 2 r}, and so \m{p^2 = 4 r^2}.

		Putting this in equation \eqref[sqrt2-notin-Q-eq1], we get \m{4 r^2 = 2 q^2}, which is the same as \m{2 r^2 = q^2}. This means that \m{q^2}, and thus \m{q}, is even.

		But we had assumed that \m{p} and \m{q} have no common factors. Thus we have a contradiction. Therefore, our supposition must be wrong, and it must be that \m{\sqrt{2}} is not rational.

		\item  It can be shown that there are numbers that are not solutions of any algebraic equation. Such numbers are called \emph{transcendental} numbers. Example: \m{π}.

		Let \m{P(n) ≡ 2^n > n}.
		
		\bold{Base case}  \m{P(1) ≡ 2^1 > 1} is true.

		\bold{Inductive step}  Suppose \m{P(k)} is true for some \m{k ∈ ℕ}. That is, suppose \m{2^k > k}.

		We have to prove that \m{P(k + 1)} is true (\comment{using the supposition}).

		From our supposition, multiplying both sides by 2, we get \m{2^{k + 1} > 2k}.

		\comment{All we need to do now is to show that \m{2k ≥ k + 1}.}

		Since \m{k ≥ 1}, \m{k + k ≥pp k + 1}. Therefore \m{2^{k + 1} > k + 1}.

		We have shown that \m{P(k + 1)} is true. The concludes the inductive step.

		By the principle of mathematical induction, \m{2^n > n} is true for every postive integer \m{n}.

		Suppose that \m{ℙ = \bcrl[p_1, p_2, ⋯, p_n]} is a set of primes for some \m{n ∈ ℕ}.

		Let \m{m = p_1 ⋅ p_2 ⋅ p_3 ⋅ ⋯ ⋅ p_n} and \m{q = m + 1}. Now, \m{q} is either a prime or it is not.

		If it is a prime, we have one more prime than our original set.

		If it is not a prime, it must be divisible by some prime \m{p}. If \m{p ∈ ℙ}, then it would divide both \m{m} and \m{m + 1}. Therefore it would divide the difference, that is, \m{p ∣ 1}, which is impossible. Therefore \m{p ∉ ℙ}.

		Therefore a new prime can always be found to any given (finite) set of primes.

		It is a common misconception that \m{q} is prime. For example, let \m{p_1 = 3} and \m{p_2 = 5}. Then \m{p_1 ⋅ p_2 + 1 = 16}, which is composite.

		Even if one considers \m{n} smallest primes, it is not true. For example, \m{2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 ⋅ 7 ⋅ 11 ⋅ 13 + 1 = 30031 = 59 ⋅ 509}.

			Prove or provide a counterexample to the following statement:

			If \m{p > 3} is prime, then \m{24 ∣ (p^2 − 1)}.

			\soln{Firstly, \m{p^2 - 1 = (p - 1)(p + 1)}. Now, \m{p - 1, p, p + 1} are consecutive numbers, so one of them must be divisible by 3, and it cannot be \m{p}. So \m{3} is a factor of \m{p^2 - 1}. Moreover, \m{p - 1} and \m{p + 1} are consecutive even numbers, so one of them must be divisible by \m{4} and the other by \m{2}. Therefore \m{p^2 - 1} must be divisible by \m{2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 4 = 24}.}

		\item  René Descartes' unified geometry and algebra into what is known as \important{analytical geometry}.

		\item  In 2D analytical geometry, equations of the form \m{a x + b y = c}, where \m{a, b, c ∈ ℝ} is given and \m{x, y ∈ ℝ} has to be found, represent a straight line in the \emph{Cartesian plane}. 

			Every point that lies on the line satisfies the equation.

			This equation has infinitely many solutions.

		\item  What can we now say about the same equation if we have \m{a, b, c ∈ ℤ} and need \m{x, y ∈ ℤ}? This is called a \important{linear Diophantine equations} in two variables.

		\item  In general, a \important{Diophantine equation} is a polynomial equation, usually in two or more unknowns, such that only integer solutions are sought or studied. These are named after the Greek mathematician/philosopher Diophantus of Alexandria (∼ 200 - 300 {\sc ad}).

		Let \m{a, b ∈ ℤ}. The equation \m{a x + b y = 1} has integral solutions iff \m{\gcd(a, b) = 1}.
	\stoptheorem

	\startproof

		\bold{(⟹)} \comment{By contradiction.}

		Let \m{d = \gcd(a, b) > 1}. Suppose there exists a solution. This mean there exists \m{m, n ∈ ℤ} such that \m{a x + b y = 1}. Now, since \m{d ∣ a} and \m{d ∣ b}, by the linear combination lemma, \m{d ∣ (a m + b n)}, so \m{d ∣ 1}. But \m{d > 1}, so this gives a contradiction.

	For the first sixth of his life, Diophantus was a boy. After another twelfth of his life, Diophantus grew beard. One-seventh of this life after this, Diophantus married. Five years after his marriage, Diophantus’s son was born. Diophantus’s son died at a relatively young age. Four years after his son died, Diophantus himself died. The total number of years the son lived is one-half the total number of years Diophantus lived.
