	\startitemize [m]

		\item  What is number theory?

		\item  Why do we study number theory?

		\item  Why do we want to \emph{prove} ideas?

		\item  More importantly, what constitutes a \emph{proof}?

		\item  Inductive vs deductive reasoning.

\startslide[title={Inductive reasoning}]

	\startitemize [4]

		\item  \bold{Inductive reasoning} derives general propositions from specific examples.
		
		\item  \bold{Caution}: \emph{We can never be sure, our conclusion(s) can be wrong!} \frown

		\item  \emph{Example} 1:
			\startitemize [n, joinedup]
				\item  We throw lots of things, very often.
				\item  In all our experiments, the things fell down and not up.
				\item  So we conclude that likely, things always fall down.
			\stopitemize

			\blank[big]
			How we may be wrong:
			\startitemize [n, joinedup]
				\item  An iron nail under a big magnet moves up (given that it is sufficiently close).
				\item  A helium balloon goes up.

		\item  \emph{Example} 2:  You ask your parent for a candy and (s)he buys it for you. You ask for a fancy shoe, and (s)he buys it. Now you ask for a Lamborghini ⋯.

		\item  \emph{Example} 3 (\emph{Black swan}):  In the 16th century, it was believed (in Europe) that swans are always white. But in 1697, Dutch explorers led by Willem de Vlamingh became the first Europeans to see black swans, in Western Australia.

		\item  \emph{Example} 4:  \m{\frac11 = 1, \frac22 = 1, \frac33 = 1, ⋯}; so clearly \m{\frac{n}{n} = 1} for every integer \m{n}.

		\item  \emph{Example} 5:  Illusions, e.g. drawings by \emph{M. C. Escher}.

	\startitemize [4]

		\item  \bold{Deductive reasoning} is deriving a logically certain conclusion from one or more premises.

		\item  We do \emph{NOT} question the premises. But \emph{if the premises are correct, then all conclusions are correct.} \smile

		\item  \emph{Example}: Question: Do \m{\bf{Q_1}} and \m{\bf{Q_2}} \emph{imply} \m{\bf{Q_3}}?
			\startitemize [5, joinedup]
				\item  (\m{\bf{Q_1}})  All men are mortal. (First premise)
				\item  (\m{\bf{Q_2}})  Socrates is a man. (Second premise)
				\item  (\m{\bf{Q_3}})  Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (Conclusion)
			\stopitemize

		\item  \emph{Example}: Question: Does \m{\bf{P_1}} and \m{\bf{P_2}} \emph{imply} \m{\bf{P_3}}?
			\startitemize [5, joinedup]
				\item  (\m{\bf{P_1}})  Borogoves are mimsy whenever it is brillig.
				\item  (\m{\bf{P_2}})  It is now brillig, and this thing is a borogove.
				\item  (\m{\bf{P_3}})  Hence this thing is mimsy.

	\startitemize [4]
		
		\item  To prove an existential proposition \important{true}, we need to find just one instance (\emph{example}) for which the proposition is \important{true}.

		\item  It is sometimes easier to prove the contrapositive of a proposition.

		\item  To prove a uniqueness proposition, proofs by contradiction is usually more convenient.

\startslide [title={Natural numbers and integers}]

	\startitemize [m]
		
		\item  From ancient times, humans have been able to identify the natural numbers.
			
			In modern mathematics, the \emph{set} of natural numbers is represented by \m{ℕ = \bcrl[1, 2, 3, ⋯]}.

		\item  We can add/subtract, and multiply/divide any two natural numbers.

		\item  Are these all the numbers there can be?

		\item  Question: Are the natural numbers \important{closed} under addition/subtraction?

			\comment{(Being closed with respect to an operation means that the result is also in the given set.)}
			\startitemize [a, joinedup]				
				\item  I had 4 objects, and I gave 4 objects to Luci. How many objects do I now have?
				\item  I owed Luci 20 \$, but I have 4 \$ with me. How much do I have?
			\stopitemize

		\item  This gives rise to the integers, \m{ℤ = \bcrl[⋯, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ⋯]}, which are \important{closed} under addition/subtraction.

		\item  From now on, we shall forget about subtraction, because subtracting an integer is essentially adding the negative of that integer. 
	\stopitemize
\stopslide

\startslide [title={Rational numbers}]
	
	\startitemize [m]

		\item  Note that the set of natural numbers is contained within the set of integers.

			In set theory, we say \quotation{\m{ℕ} is a \important{subset} of \m{ℤ}}, and denote this by \m{ℕ ⊂ ℤ}.
		
		\item  Are the integers closed with respect to multiplication/division?

		\item  This gives rise to the set of rational numbers, \m{ℚ = \bcrl[\frac{p}{q} : p, q ∈ ℤ, q ≠ 0]}.

		\item  And now we can forget about division since it is simply multiplication with the inverse of the number.

		\item  Is that all we have?

		\item  Let's go on a journey.
	\stopitemize

\startslide [title={Time Travel adventures: Part 1}]

	Date: around 550 BC

	Place: Pythagoras's office in Samos, Greece

	Stage: Pythagoras has recently claimed that he has proved a major equality about the sides of right-angled triangles. We go there to investigate his claims.

	\blank[big]

	Unfortunately, a lot of people have been trying do the same, so he has a filtering mechanism in place. We need to answer the following question to get in:
	
	\startitemize [m]
	
		\item  What is the area of a rectangle of dimensions \m{a × b}?
		
		\item  What is the area of a right angled triangle of base \m{b} and height \m{h}?

			But of course, now he wants a proof of that fact.

			\comment{(Remember that Pythagoras is a geometer, so he is very happy with a geometric proof.)}
		
		\item  What is the sum of angles of a triangle?
	\stopitemize

	Once we answer these question, we get to see Pythagoras's proof.

\startslide [title={We start with a lemma}]
	
	\startlemma
		Let \m{n} be an integer. The \m{n^2} is even iff \m{n} is even.
	\stoplemma

	\startproof
		\comment{Note that this is a ⟺ statement. So we can break it into two parts.}

		Before we look at the individual directions, let us note that when \m{p} is an integer, so are \m{p^2}, \m{2 p}, \m{2 p^2}, and \m{2 p^2 + 2p}.

		\bold{(⟸)}
		\comment{We use a direct proof for this direction.}

		Since \m{n} is even, there is an integer \m{p} such that \m{n = 2p}. Now, \m{n^2 = (2 p)^2 = 4 p^2 = 2 (2 p^2)}, so \m{n^2} is even.

		\bold{(⟹)}
		\comment{We prove this by proving the contrapositive.}

		Suppose \m{n} is \emph{not} even, that is, \m{n} is odd. Then we can write \m{n = 2 p + 1} for some integer \m{p}. Then \m{n^2 = (2 p + 1)^2 = 4 p^2 + 4 p + 1 = 2 (2 p^2 + 2 p) + 1}, so \m{n^2} is also odd.

	\comment{Remark: A \emph{lemma} is a proposition that leads to a bigger result, which are usually called \emph{theorems}. \emph{Corollaries} are applications or minor modifications of theorems that are themselves quite important. From a \emph{logic}al viewpoint, there is no difference between lemmas, propositions, theorems, or corollaries.}

\startslide [title={Rationality of \m{\sqrt2}}]
	
	\starttheorem
		\m{\sqrt2} is not rational.
	\stoptheorem

	\startproof
		\comment{We prove this by contradiction.}

		Suppose \m{\sqrt2} is rational. Then it can be written in the form \m{\frac{p}{q}}, where \m{p, q} are integers with \m{q ≠ 0}. Assume that \m{p} and \m{q} have no common factors, for if they do, we can reduce the fraction to its lowest terms and then call the numerator \m{p} and the denominator \m{q}.

		Squaring and simplifying, we get
		\placeformula[sqrt2-notin-Q-eq1]  \startformula
			p^2 = 2 q^2 .

		This means \m{p^2} is even. By the previous lemma, \m{p} is also even. Therefore, there exists an integer \m{r} such that \m{p = 2 r}, and so \m{p^2 = 4 r^2}.

		Putting this in equation \eqref[sqrt2-notin-Q-eq1], we get \m{4 r^2 = 2 q^2}, which is the same as \m{2 r^2 = q^2}. This means that \m{q^2}, and thus \m{q}, is even.

		But we had assumed that \m{p} and \m{q} have no common factors. Thus we have a contradiction. Therefore, our supposition must be wrong, and it must be that \m{\sqrt{2}} is not rational.

		\item  We showed that if we desire closure with respect to solutions of algebraic equations, we end up with numbers which may not be rational.

		\item  \emph{Algebraic} numbers are numbers that are solutions of algebraic equations. For example, \m{\sqrt{2}} is the solution of the algebraic equation \m{x^2 = 2}, and is thus algebraic.

		\item  It can be shown that there are numbers that are not solutions of any algebraic equation. Such numbers are called \emph{transcendental} numbers. Example: \m{π}.

		\item  All rational numbers are algebraic. But the converse is not true, e.g. \m{\sqrt{2}}.

		\item  The set of all algebraic and transcendental numbers is called the set of \emph{real} numbers.

		\item  The set of real numbers that are not rational is called the set of \emph{irrational} numbers.

		\comment{This is a proof by mathematical induction.}

		Let \m{P(n) ≡ 2^n > n}.
		
		\bold{Base case}  \m{P(1) ≡ 2^1 > 1} is true.

		\bold{Inductive step}  Suppose \m{P(k)} is true for some \m{k ∈ ℕ}. That is, suppose \m{2^k > k}.

		We have to prove that \m{P(k + 1)} is true (\comment{using the supposition}).

		From our supposition, multiplying both sides by 2, we get \m{2^{k + 1} > 2k}.

		\comment{All we need to do now is to show that \m{2k ≥ k + 1}.}

		Since \m{k ≥ 1}, \m{k + k ≥pp k + 1}. Therefore \m{2^{k + 1} > k + 1}.

		We have shown that \m{P(k + 1)} is true. The concludes the inductive step.

		By the principle of mathematical induction, \m{2^n > n} is true for every postive integer \m{n}.

		There are infinitely many primes.
	\stoptheorem

	\startproof
		Suppose that \m{ℙ = \bcrl[p_1, p_2, ⋯, p_n]} is a set of primes for some \m{n ∈ ℕ}.

		Let \m{m = p_1 ⋅ p_2 ⋅ p_3 ⋅ ⋯ ⋅ p_n} and \m{q = m + 1}. Now, \m{q} is either a prime or it is not.

		If it is a prime, we have one more prime than our original set.

		If it is not a prime, it must be divisible by some prime \m{p}. If \m{p ∈ ℙ}, then it would divide both \m{m} and \m{m + 1}. Therefore it would divide the difference, that is, \m{p ∣ 1}, which is impossible. Therefore \m{p ∉ ℙ}.

		Therefore a new prime can always be found to any given (finite) set of primes.
	\stopproof

	\startremark
		It is a common misconception that \m{q} is prime. For example, let \m{p_1 = 3} and \m{p_2 = 5}. Then \m{p_1 ⋅ p_2 + 1 = 16}, which is composite.

		Even if one considers \m{n} smallest primes, it is not true. For example, \m{2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 ⋅ 7 ⋅ 11 ⋅ 13 + 1 = 30031 = 59 ⋅ 509}.
