	\startitemize [4]

		\item  \bold{Inductive reasoning} derives general propositions from specific examples.
		
		\item  \bold{Caution}: \emph{We can never be sure, our conclusion(s) can be wrong!} \frown

		\item  \emph{Example} 1:
			\startitemize [n, joinedup]
				\item  We throw lots of things, very often.
				\item  In all our experiments, the things fell down and not up.
				\item  So we conclude that likely, things always fall down.

			\startitemize [n, joinedup]
				\item  An iron nail under a big magnet moves up (given that it is sufficiently close).

		\item  \emph{Example} 2:  You ask your parent for a candy and (s)he buys it for you. You ask for a fancy shoe, and (s)he buys it. Now you ask for a Lamborghini ⋯.

		\item  \emph{Example} 3 (\emph{Black swan}):  In the 16th century, it was believed (in Europe) that swans are always white. But in 1697, Dutch explorers led by Willem de Vlamingh became the first Europeans to see black swans, in Western Australia.

		\item  \emph{Example} 4:  \m{\frac11 = 1, \frac22 = 1, \frac33 = 1, ⋯}; so clearly \m{\frac{n}{n} = 1} for every integer \m{n}.

		\item  From ancient times, humans have been able to identify the natural numbers.
			
			In modern mathematics, the \emph{set} of natural numbers is represented by \m{ℕ = \bcrl[1, 2, 3, ⋯]}.

		\item  We can add/subtract, and multiply/divide any two natural numbers.

		\item  Are these all the numbers there can be?

		\item  Question: Are the natural numbers \important{closed} under addition/subtraction?

		\item  This gives rise to the integers, \m{ℤ = \bcrl[⋯, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ⋯]}, which are \important{closed} under addition/subtraction.

\startslide [title={Time Travel adventures: Part 1}]

	Date: around 550 BC

	Place: Pythagoras's office in Samos, Greece

	Stage: Pythagoras has recently claimed that he has proved a major equality about the sides of right-angled triangles. We go there to investigate his claims.

	\blank[big]

	Unfortunately, a lot of people have been trying do the same, so he has a filtering mechanism in place. We need to answer the following question to get in:
	
	\startitemize [m]
	
		\item  What is the area of a rectangle of dimensions \m{a × b}?
		
		\item  What is the area of a right angled triangle of base \m{b} and height \m{h}?

			But of course, now he wants a proof of that fact.

			\comment{(Remember that Pythagoras is a geometer, so he is very happy with a geometric proof.)}

	\startlemma
		Let \m{n} be an integer. The \m{n^2} is even iff \m{n} is even.
	\stoplemma

	\startproof
		\comment{Note that this is a ⟺ statement. So we can break it into two parts.}

		Before we look at the individual directions, let us note that when \m{p} is an integer, so are \m{p^2}, \m{2 p}, \m{2 p^2}, and \m{2 p^2 + 2p}.

		\bold{(⟸)}
		\comment{We use a direct proof for this direction.}

		Since \m{n} is even, there is an integer \m{p} such that \m{n = 2p}. Now, \m{n^2 = (2 p)^2 = 4 p^2 = 2 (2 p^2)}, so \m{n^2} is even.

		\bold{(⟹)}
		\comment{We prove this by proving the contrapositive.}

		Suppose \m{n} is \emph{not} even, that is, \m{n} is odd. Then we can write \m{n = 2 p + 1} for some integer \m{p}. Then \m{n^2 = (2 p + 1)^2 = 4 p^2 + 4 p + 1 = 2 (2 p^2 + 2 p) + 1}, so \m{n^2} is also odd.

\startslide [title={Rationality of \m{\sqrt2}}]
	
	\starttheorem
		\m{\sqrt2} is not rational.
	\stoptheorem

	\startproof
		\comment{We prove this by contradiction.}

		Suppose \m{\sqrt2} is rational. Then it can be written in the form \m{\frac{p}{q}}, where \m{p, q} are integers with \m{q ≠ 0}. Assume that \m{p} and \m{q} have no common factors, for if they do, we can reduce the fraction to its lowest terms and then call the numerator \m{p} and the denominator \m{q}.

		Squaring and simplifying, we get
		\placeformula[sqrt2-notin-Q-eq1]  \startformula
			p^2 = 2 q^2 .
		\stopformula
		This means \m{p^2} is even. By the previous lemma, \m{p} is also even. Therefore, there exists an integer \m{r} such that \m{p = 2 r}, and so \m{p^2 = 4 r^2}.

		Putting this in equation \eqref[sqrt2-notin-Q-eq1], we get \m{4 r^2 = 2 q^2}, which is the same as \m{2 r^2 = q^2}. This means that \m{q^2}, and thus \m{q}, is even.

		But we had assumed that \m{p} and \m{q} have no common factors. Thus we have a contradiction. Therefore, our supposition must be wrong, and it must be that \m{\sqrt{2}} is not rational.
	\stopproof

\startslide [title={Real numbers}]
	
	\startitemize [m]
		
		\item  We showed that if we desire closure with respect to solutions of algebraic equations, we end up with numbers which may not be rational.

		\item  \emph{Algebraic} numbers are numbers that are solutions of algebraic equations. For example, \m{\sqrt{2}} is the solution of the algebraic equation \m{x^2 = 2}, and is thus algebraic.

		\item  It can be shown that there are numbers that are not solutions of any algebraic equation. Such numbers are called \emph{transcendental} numbers. Example: \m{π}.

		\item  All rational numbers are algebraic. But the converse is not true.

		\item  The set of all algebraic and transcendental numbers is called the set of \emph{real} numbers.

		\item  The set of real numbers that are not rational is called the set of \emph{irrational} numbers.

		\item  Closure with respect to square roots of negative number gives us an even bigger set, called the \emph{complex} numbers.

	\startdefinition [title={Laplace principle}]
		\m{(X_n)} is said to satisfy the \important{Laplace principle on \m{𝓧} with rate function \m{I}} if for all bounded continuous functions \m{h}, we have
		\startformula
			\lim  \frac1n \log 𝔼\exp(-n h(X_n))  =  \inf_𝓧 (h + I)
		\stopformula
	\stopdefinition

	\starttheorem
		\m{(X_n)} satisfies LP on \m{𝓧} with rate function \m{I} if and only if \m{(X_n)} satisfies LDP on \m{𝓧} with the same rate function \m{I}.
	\stoptheorem

	\bold{Some important results}
	\startitemize [5, nowhite]
		\item  Uniqueness of the rate function.
		\item  Continuity principle.
			% Let \m{f:𝓧 → 𝓨} be a continuous map of Polish spaces. Then \m{(f(X_n))} satisfies Laplace principle with rate function \m{J(y) = \inf \bcrl[I(x): x ∈ {\inv[f]}(y)]}.
		\item  Superexponential approximation preserves Laplace principle.
		  % If \m{(Y_n)} is superexponentially close to \m{(X_n)}, then \m{(Y_n)} satisfies Laplace principle with the same rate function \m{I}.
