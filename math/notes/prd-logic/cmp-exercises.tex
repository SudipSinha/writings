			\item  If either \m{Σ ⊨ α} or \m{Σ ⊨ β}, then \m{Σ ⊨ (α ∨ β)}.

				\startsolution
					(\bold{⊤})  \qquad
					There are two cases: \m{Σ ⊨ α} and \m{Σ ⊨ β}. Without loss of generality, we can assume that \m{Σ ⊨ α}, as the argument for other case is exactly the same. This means any arbitrary truth assignment \m{v} satisfying \m{Σ} also satisfies \m{α}. This implies \m{\bar{v}(α ∨ β) = ⊤} by the definition of extension of \m{\bar{v}} for \m{∨}.
				\stopsolution

			\item  If \m{Σ ⊨ (α ∨ β)}, then either \m{Σ ⊨ α} or \m{Σ ⊨ β}.

				\startsolution
					(\bold{⊥})  \qquad
					We give a counterexample. Let \m{α} be a sentence symbol and \m{Σ = ∅}. Then it is always true that \m{⊨ (α ∨ (¬α))}. But it does not follow that \m{⊨ α} or \m{⊨ (¬α)}.

					For an explicit example, consider two truth assignments \m{v_1} and \m{v_2}, such that \m{v_1(α) = ⊤} and \m{v_2(α) = ⊥}. In this case, \m{⊨ α} is not true since \m{v_2} does not satisfy \m{α}, and \m{⊨ (¬α)} is not true since \m{v_1} does not satisfy \m{(¬α)}.

			\item[uniqueness]  Show that if \m{v_1} and \m{v_2} are truth assignments which agree on all the sentence symbols in the wff \m{α}, then \m{\bar{v}_1(α)} = \m{\bar{v}_2(α)}.

				\startsolution
					
					Let \m{G} be the set of sentence symbols used in \m{α}, and let \m{B = \bcrl[ϕ \text{ wff}: \bar{v}_1(ϕ) = \bar{v}_2(ϕ)]}. All we need to show is that \m{α ∈ B}.

					Firstly, \m{G ⊆ B} since \m{v_1} and \m{v_2} agree on the sentence symbols used in \m{α}.

					Secondly, let \m{ϕ, ψ ∈ B} (arbitrary), so \m{v_1} and \m{v_2} agree on \m{ϕ} and \m{ψ}. Let \m{⊡ ∈ \bcrl[∧, ∨, →, ↔]}. Since conditions 1–5 on page 20–21 are the same for \m{\bar{v}_1} and \m{\bar{v}_2}, we have \m{\bar{v}_1(¬ ϕ) = \bar{v}_2(¬ ϕ)} and \m{\bar{v}_1(ϕ ⊡ ψ) = \bar{v}_2(ϕ ⊡ ψ)}. Hence \m{(¬ϕ), (ϕ ⊡ ψ) ∈ B}, that is, \m{B} is closed with respect to the formula building operations.

					Therefore, by the induction principle, \m{B} is the set of \emph{all} wffs generated by the formula building operations. So \m{α ∈ B}, and we are done.

			\item  Let \m{S} be a set of sentence symbols that includes those in \m{Σ} and \m{τ} (and possibly more). Show that \m{Σ ⊨ τ} iff every truth assignment for \m{S} which satisfies every member of \m{Σ} also satisfies \m{τ}.

				\startsolution
					In this part, we use \m{v} to denote truth assignments and \quotation{\m{v} on a set} means \m{v} is defined on that set. Let \m{G} be the set of sentence symbols used in \m{Σ} and \m{τ}. Clearly, \m{G ⊆ S}.

					We show each direction separately.

					\startformula  \startalign[n=3]
						\NC     \NC  Σ ⊨ τ  \NR
						\NC  ⟺  \NC  (∀ v \text{ on } G) ((v \text{ satisfies } Σ) → (v \text{ satisfies } τ))  \NR

					\stopalign  \stopformula
					
					\bold{(\m{⟸})}  \qquad
					Since \m{Σ} and \m{τ} does not depend on any element of \m{S ∖ G}, restricting the definition of \m{v} from \m{S} to \m{G} will not change anything on \m{Σ} and \m{τ}. Therefore,
					\startformula  \startalign
						\NC     \NC  (∀ v \text{ on } S) ((v \text{ satisfies } Σ) → (v \text{ satisfies } τ))  \NR
