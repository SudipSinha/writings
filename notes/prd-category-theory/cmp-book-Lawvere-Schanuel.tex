		We have four equations:

		0 can be mapped to either b, p, or q. 1 can be mapped to either r, or s. So total number of possibilities = 3 × 2 = 6. In general, the number of sections is given by \m{∏_{b ∈ \im f} \inv[f](b)}, where \m{\inv[f]} represents the preimage of \m{f}.

		Let \m{f: A → B, g: B → C} has sections \m{s_f: B → A, s_g: C → B}, respectively. That is, \m{f s_f = 1_B} and \m{g s_g = 1_C}. Now, \m{(g f) (s_f	 s_g)  =  g (f s_f)	 s_g  =  g 1_B	 s_g  =  g s_g  =  1_C}, so \m{s_f	 s_g} is a section for \m{g f}.

		We have two separate theorems.

		\dscr{(FPT)}  Any continuous endomap of \m{B^{n + 1}} has a fixed point.

		\dscr{(NRT)}  There is not continuous retraction for the inclusion \m{j: S^n → B^{n + 1}}.

		We want to show that (FPT) ⟺ (NRT).

		\dscr{(⟸)}  Equivalently, ¬(FPT) ⟹ ¬(NRT). This is the proof he gives.

		\dscr{(⟹)}  This is Exercise 3.

		Use the same idea as what he proves, but use \m{g(x)} instead of \m{x}, and use the fact that \m{gj = j}, so points on the boundary are still mapped to themselves.
	\stopsection

	\startsection [title={Session 10, Exercise 2}]
		To show that \m{A} has the fixed point property, we have to show that for any \m{g: A → A}, there exists \m{y: T → A} such that \m{gy = y}. Now, from the diagram, and using the fixed point property of \m{X}, since \m{sgr: X → X}, there is \m{x: T → X} such that \m{(sgr)x = x}. Premultiplying by \m{r} and using \m{rs = 1_A}, we get \m{g(rx) = (rx)}, so \m{y = rx} is the required map.

	\startsection [title={Session 10, Exercise 3}]
		Assume (FPT) is true. Exercise 2 says that if there is a continuous retraction \m{r: B^{n + 1} → S^n}, then if \m{B^{n + 1}} has the fixed-point property, so does \m{S^n}. But even though the antipodal map \m{a: B^{n + 1} → B^{n + 1}} has a fixed-point, the map \m{a\big|_{S^n}: S^n → S^n} has no fixed-points. So it must be that there is no continuous retraction \m{r: B^{n + 1} → S^n}, which is (NRT).

		Say we want an bijection between \m{B^2} and \m{S^1}. We can do it as follows:
		\startitemize [n, nowhite, after]
			\item  Use the linear isomorphism \m{T: B^2 → I^2: x ↦ R_{\frac{π}{4}} S_{\sqrt{2}} x}, where \m{R_{\frac{π}{4}} = R, S_{\sqrt{2}} = S} are given by

			\item  Use the \m{C^∞} bijection \m{f: I^2 → ℝ^2: (x, y) ↦ \brnd[\frac{x}{1 - x^2}, \frac{y}{1 - y^2}]} (or any bijection).
			\item  Use any bijection from \m{ℝ^2} to \m{ℝ}.
			\item  Now we need a bijection from \m{ℝ} to \m{S^1}, or equivalently, from \m{S^1} to \m{ℝ}. We construct it as follows. Use \m{u: S^1 → (S^1 + (0, 1)): x ↦ x + (0, 1)} to push the 1-sphere upwards, and then use the stereographic projection to project \m{(S^1 + (0, 1)) ∖ \bcrl[(0, 2)]} onto the real line. We delete the north pole this because both the poles project onto the origin. Now compose this with the shift map
			\startformula
				s: ℝ → ℝ: x ↦
				\startmathcases
					\NC  x + 1  \MC  x ∈ ℕ  \NR
					\NC  x  \MC  x ∉ ℕ  \NR
				\stopmathcases .
			\stopformula
			This frees us the origin, so we now map the north pole to the origin to get the required bijection.

		It is interesting to note that even though commutativity of each block implies commutativity of the diagram, commutativity of the diagram does not imply commutativity of the block. In fact, take only the \m{s} arrows and assume commutativity of the whole diagram and the left block. This gives \m{s'' g_A f_A = g_D f_D s} and \m{f_D s = s' f_A}, so premultiplying the second equation by \m{g_D} gives us \m{g_D s' f_A  =  g_D f_D s  =  s'' g_A f_A}. Thus the right block commutes if and only if \m{f_A} is an epimorphism.
